## Getting Started - Installation
You can choose from different installation options based on your preference:

### Microsoft Store (recommended)
Download the latest version from the [Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P67C2D4T9FB?ocid=pdpshare) page this is the recommended option because you will recieve updates, and a secure version of the program.

#### Pay vs Free trial
There are no differences between them, both the paid version and the free trial offer exactly the same features. The option to purchase is simply a way to donate and support my work in developing this application.

### Installer (Setup.exe)
Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/eythaann/seelen-ui/releases) page and run the `setup.exe` installer. This will notify for new updates but maybe is detected as virus because actually is not signed.

## Usage

## What is a Tiling Window Manager?

A Tiling Window Manager (TWM) is a window manager that automatically organizes applications into non-overlapping tiles instead of overlapping them. This optimizes screen space and simplifies application navigation through keyboard shortcuts.

### Why Should You Consider Using It?

- **Spatial Efficiency:** Maximize your screen real estate, allowing you to work with multiple applications without overlapping.

- **Enhanced Productivity:** Quickly navigate between applications with keyboard shortcuts and easily split the screen for efficient multitasking.

- **Total Customization:** Tailor window arrangement and keyboard shortcuts according to your preferences.

- **Seamless Experience:** Eliminate visual distractions by avoiding overlapping windows.

In summary, a Tiling Window Manager can transform your computing experience, offering spatial efficiency, enhanced productivity, and an interface tailored to your needs. If you value space optimization and agility in navigating between applications, consider making the switch!

## Deep Dive into the Maximalist Fork of Komorebi

Seelen UI mantains a user-friendly fork of Komorebi, a tiling window manager for Windows. While the original Komorebi primarily offers a CLI (Command Line Interface) and may not be very accessible to non-programmers, Seelen UI aims to provide a visually appealing, intuitive interface for users who may not have programming skills. This project enhances usability and aesthetic details while introducing additional features to make Komorebi more accessible.

Seelen UI is not just a fork; it's a maximalist fork of the original Komorebi. This means that it deviates significantly from the simplicity of Komorebi, embracing a more feature-rich approach. Unlike a retrocompatible fork, Seelen UI introduces additional features and is not backward compatible with the original Komorebi CLI.

### Key Differences

- **Maximalist Approach:** Seelen UI takes a maximalist approach, providing a comprehensive set of features beyond the simplicity of the original Komorebi.

- **Enhanced Usability:** The user interface is designed to be more accessible, making it suitable for both developers and non-programmers.

- **Migration Assistance:** Despite the lack of retrocompatibility, Seelen UI offers a smooth migration path for users coming from the Komorebi CLI. The GUI provides an easy transition, allowing users to leverage the power of Seelen UI effortlessly.

### Why Maximalist?

The decision for a maximalist fork stems from the desire to offer a feature-rich experience. While the original Komorebi aims to be as simple as possible, Seelen UI embraces complexity to provide a more versatile and powerful window management solution.
