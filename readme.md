## Overview

Komorebi UI is a user-friendly fork of Komorebi, a tiling window manager for Windows. While the original Komorebi primarily offers a CLI (Command Line Interface) and may not be very accessible to non-programmers, Komorebi UI aims to provide a visually appealing, intuitive interface for users who may not have programming skills. This project enhances usability and aesthetic details while introducing additional features to make Komorebi more accessible.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with a focus on usability, ensuring a seamless experience for both novice and experienced users.

- **Visual Appeal:** Attention to aesthetic details to create an attractive and enjoyable interface.

- **Additional Functionality:** Includes extra features that enhance the overall usability of Komorebi.
